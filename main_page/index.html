                        This is a fanmade Arknights wiki. HTML and CSS have been pretty fun so far, but it is starting to be clear
                        that my designing skills are lacking. This is my first attempt at fully designing a web myself, so hopefully it turns out okay. Arknights is a gacha
                        game so it is not for everyone, but my friends find it quite fun and entertaining.

                        There are more space here that I need to fill but filling it with lorem is boring so I will fill this with random facts. Vancouver got its name from a British 
                        explorer of Dutch descend called George Vancouver. Vancouver in Dutch is "Van Coeverden", meaning "from Coeverden" which is a town in the Netherlands.
                        Something, or someone rather, also from the Netherlands was Edsger W. Dijkstra, the founder of the famous Dijkstra Algorithm. The Netherlands was also where the richest company ever was 
                         formed, the VOC. It was so wealthy that it had its own currency and private military.

                        Arknights and its media are copyrighted so I can only pick copyright free images that are somehow related. For example, the nations in Arknights are based on real countries so I have put their
                        flags here. The characters are also based on animals so I have put stock images of the animals they are based on. This course was overall fun, and I'm glad that I'm taking it. Thank you for the awesome 4 months!
