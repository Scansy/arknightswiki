                    This fanmade Arknights wikipedia is made by me, Matthew Widjaja. HTML and CSS have been pretty fun so far, but it is starting to be clear
                    that I may lack artistic talent. This is my first attempt at fully designing a web myself, so hopefully it turns out okay. Arknights is a gacha
                    game so it is not for everyone, but my friends find it quite fun and entertaining.

                    There are more space here that I need to fill but filling it with lorem is boring so I will fill this with random facts. Vancouver got its name from a British 
                    explorer of Dutch descend called George Vancouver. Vancouver in Dutch is "Van Coeverden", meaning "from Coeverden" which is a town in the Netherlands.

                    Arknights and its media are copyrighted so I can only pick copyright free images that is somehow related. For example, the nations in Arknights are based on real countries so I have put their
                    flags here. The characters are also based on animals so I have put stock images of the animals they are based on.
