                <p>
                    Arknights is a free-to-play, 2D tower defense game developed by Hyperglyph. The game was released in 2019 in China and 2020 for the rest of the world.
                    The game features anime-style characters with a deep story and rich worldbuilding. The gameplay involves placing "operators" on a stage to stop waves of enemies
                    from reaching a point in the stage.

                    An action RPG spin-off planned for PC and mobile called "Arknights: Endfield" was announced in March 2022. An anime series of the show was aired from October to December 2022,
                    produced by Yostar Pictures with a second season planned.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    Arknights features the player (often referred to as "the Doctor") commanding a cast of characters (or "operators") to stop a group of enemies from reaching a designated point in the level, colored blue.
                    Each stage contains pathways for the enemies to go from their spawn point to the designated blue point(s). The user could place operators either in the path of the enemies, allowing them to block or on separate, elevated
                    tiles for operators to attack from a range. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Operators are categorized into different classes, each with unique roles and different upsides and downsides. The enemies also vary in the amount of health they have, their speed, their attack damage, and sometimes even contain unique traits.

                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>
                    Arknights take place in a dystopian, post-apocalypse future in a planet called Terra, similar to earth. Terra possesses a fictional mineral
                    called "originium", which is the main source of energy on the planet. The mining of this minerals have caused some to be infected with "oripathy", a progressive disease with no cure and high fatality rate but grants
                    the infected host "arts" magic.

                <p>
                    The player, in the game often referred to as "the Doctor", takes the role of a commander for a pharmaceutical company called "Rhodes Island" whose purpose is to find
                    a cure for oripathy. Despite being a pharmaceutical company, Rhodes Island possesses a private military that the player commands. The main story consists of the Doctor 
                    fighting a terrorist group consisting of infected individuals called "Reunion".
