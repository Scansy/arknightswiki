                <p>
                    Yan, formally known as Great Yan, is a nation in Terra that is based on China. It is an ancient nation that has existed for many centuries and is led by an imperial monarchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yan is a big and prosperous country, with a robust economy and beautiful landscapes. Yan, unlike many nations in Terra, shows great tolerance to its racial diversity, sometimes even endorsing minorities. However, it still treats the infected harshly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yan's cities are unique in the sense that each has their own specific administrative roles. It's largest city, Lungmen, acts as an economic zone while Yumen is governed by the military.
