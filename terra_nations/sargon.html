                <p>
                    Sargon, formerlly the Sargon Empire, is a nation in Arknights that is based on the real world region
                    of the middle east. The nation is comprised of both dry deserts and wet, lush tropical rainforests. Despite being one of the 
                    oldest an politically influential nation in Terra, it is currently facing hardships and separatism. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nation is led by a king called "Shahanshah" that resides in "the Golden City". However, the shahanshah is practically powerless
                    and the nation is led by regional warlords and clan leaders instead. The arid deserts of Sargon is the center of many conflicts and 
                    where many mercenaries are hired to do skirmishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The jungles of Sargon is primarily inhabited by primitives tribes of the Archosaurian and Pythian races. They seldom have
                     contact to the outside world, but this leads to a very unique culture that is vastly different from the rest of Sargon.

                        Scene is a photographer by trade, and she owns her own robot photographer to help Rhodes Island survey the landscape and battlefield. She is weak on her own, so she 
                        relies on other operators' support.

                        Sesa came from a weathy family and went to a polytechnic university. Despite this, he 
                        works in a blackmarket, modifying equipments and weaponries. He discovered and applied to Rhodes Island from his work, and his application 
                        was shady at best.
